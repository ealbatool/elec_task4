# note : this raspiratory contaion two parts oif task 4 in electrical track in smart methods training. 
# note : the code is attached in a file named ( code of the project ).
# part 1
- control 4 dc motors connected to L293D chip using arduino in wat in moves forward for 30s then backward for 60s and finally altrnate the direction for 60s. 
- the files are named : week 5 DC motor task. A PNG file and brd file are provided.

# part 2
- the function in this task is to avoid obstacles by adding a servo motor that rotates a sensor above it to check for obstacles before moving forward. If an obstacle is detected the direction of the motor will change.
- the files of this part named week 5 task. A PNG file and brd file are provided.
